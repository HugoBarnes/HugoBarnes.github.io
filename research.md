My research this summer has had 2 focii. The first is examining bias in Large Language Models through text based games. I am primarily working with [Professor Hartvigsen][th] on this. 

The second avenue is focused on developing and improving advanced reinforcement learning algorithms for the healthcare space. We are devloping a modified DQN / Critor Actor network to tackle the combinatoric action space that is modern healthcare. We are currently using a modified gridworld as a proxy for healthcare data. This project is led by [Matt Landers][ml] and [Professor Hartvigsen][th].
