The nature of this summer's research has been remote. For one hour a week via zoom I met with [Professor Hartvigsen][th] and [Matt Landers][ml] individually. Additionally, I joined the team group's meetings for each of the respective projects. Also one hour a week. 

Below are the slides that I presented to Matt Landers and Professor Hartvigsen during our meetings. These individual meeting times were opportunities to present my findings.
